# Music-Genaration-using-Deep-Learning

we will explore building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for music generation. 
We will train a model to learn the patterns in raw sheet music in ABC notation and then use this model to generate new music.

We've gathered a dataset of thousands of Irish folk songs, represented in the ABC notation. Let's download the dataset and inspect it. [input.txt]
